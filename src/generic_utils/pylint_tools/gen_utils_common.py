# is setup as expected which includes pylint_django and pylint_plugin_utils.  The more appropriate way to do this is
# to create a whole new pylint plugin python package, but the need is not quite there yet.

    """A pylint augmentation method which augments a TypeCheck visit on Factory subclasses so that if a getattr
    attempt is made on a Factory then this will actually determine the target class that the factory is for and
    validate the getattr against that whereas by default Pylint would not know about the Metaclass behavior of the
    Factoryboy Factory and would complain with a no-member error.

    The only limitation of this implementation right now is that this suppresses a type check error, but it DOES NOT
    provide type inferring of the requested attribute, which means that if for instance the requested attr is a function
    pylint will not be able to do any additional checking on the usage of the method.  This would normally be done as a
    transform hook, however it appears that at that point in time the whole class hierarchy is not loaded yet so there
    is not a way to do a is_subclass check at that time.  Since this Factory based augementation requires that check
    we have to do it down here.
