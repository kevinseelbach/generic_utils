"""Module which provides decorators for labeling of tests with categories for the purpose of filtering based on the
assigned category.

The primary usage is through the short hand decorators such as `slow_test` which would be used as the following

>>> @slow_test
>>> def do_some_test():
>>>     pass

or

>>> @slow_test()
>>> def do_some_test():
>>>     pass

These are just wrappers around the `nose.plugins.attrib` decorator which allows for filtering of tests based on
attribute.  In order to run all tests but exclude the "slow" tests you could then run ::

    > bin/test -a category='not slow' -a '!category'
